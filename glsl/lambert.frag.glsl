// This is a fragment shader. If you've opened this file first, please
// open and read lambert.vert.glsl before reading on.
// Unlike the vertex shader, the fragment shader actually does compute
// the shading of geometry. For every pixel in your program's output
// screen, the fragment shader is run for every bit of geometry that
// particular pixel overlaps. By implicitly interpolating the position
// data passed into the fragment shader by the vertex shader, the fragment shader
// can compute what color to apply to its pixel based on things like vertex
// position, light position, and vertex color.a

uniform vec4 u_Color; // The color with which to render this instance of geometry.
uniform int u_Time;
uniform int u_RenderMode;
// These are the interpolated values out of the rasterizer, so you can't know
// their specific values without knowing the vertices that contributed to them

        float theta = (((u_Time) >> 3) * gl_FragCoord.x / 7.f) * gl_FragCoord.y;
        float weight = cos(theta);
        diffuseColor.rgb += (weight )*u_RenderMode;
        // Calculate the diffuse term for Lambert shading
        float diffuseTerm = dot(normalize(fs_Nor), normalize(fs_LightVec));
